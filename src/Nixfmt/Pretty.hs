-- Function application
-- Some example mapping of Nix code to Doc (using brackets as groups, but omitting the outermost group
-- and groups around the expressions for conciseness):
-- `f a` -> pre f line a post
-- `f g a` -> pre [f line g] line a post
-- `f g h a` -> pre [[f line g] line h] line a post
-- `f g h i a` -> pre [[[f line g] line h] line i] line a post
-- As you can see, it separates the elements by `line` whitespace. However, there are three tricks to make it look good:
-- First, for each function call (imagine the fully parenthesised Nix code), we group it. Due to the greedy expansion
-- of groups this means that it will place as many function calls on the first line as possible, but then all the remaining
-- ones on a separate line each.
-- Second, the last argument is declared as "priority" group, meaning that the layouting algorithm will try to expand
-- it first when things do not fit onto one line. This allows the last argument to be multi-line without forcing the
-- preceding arguments to be multiline.
-- Third, callers may inject `pre` and `post` tokens (mostly newlines) into the inside of the group.
-- This means that callers can say "try to be compact first, but if more than the last argument does not fit onto the line,
-- then start on a new line instead".
-- Out of necessity, callers may also inject `commentPre` and `commentPost`, which will be added before/after the entire
-- thing if the function has a comment associated with its first token
