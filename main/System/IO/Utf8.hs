-- | Helpers for implementing tools that process UTF-8 encoded data.
--
-- Standard IO functions assume that the character encoding of the data
-- they read or write is the same as the one used by current locale. In many
-- situations this assumption is wrong, as tools work with files, and
-- the files nowadays are mostly UTF-8 encoded, regardless of the locale.
-- Therefore, it is almost always a good idea to switch the encoding of
-- file handles to UTF-8.
--
-- The same applies to standard input, output, and error handles. However,
-- there is an edge-case: if they are attached to a terminal, and the
-- encoding is not UTF-8, using UTF-8 might actually be unsafe.
--
-- Functions in this module help deal with all these issues.
